# About

Ioreth is a **very experimental** APRS bot. There is a lot f things to be
done yet, including writing the documentation. For now, you are welcome to
use it as you want.

Note that transmitting on the usual APRS ham bands requires (at least) an
Amateur Radio license and additional conditions and limitations for this
particular mode of operation may apply on your country or region. You MUST
ensure compliance with your local regulations before transmitting, but all
other uses are only subjected to the GNU GPLv3+ (see license bellow).

Connecting this program to the APRS-IS network also requires a license as
you will be, effectively, operating remote transmitters through the Internet.

# Additional notes from Angelo 4I1RAC/N2RAC

This fork of Ioreth was modified by Angelo 4I1RAC/N2RAC to support additional
functionalities, such as a means to store callsigns from a "net" checkin
as well as a means to forward messages to all stations checked in for the day
It is also supported by local cron jobs on my own machine and web server
to publish the net log on a regular basis.
 
Pardon my code. My knowledge is very rudimentary, and I only modify or create
functions as I need them. If anyone can help improve on the code and the
logic of this script, I would very much appreciate it.
You may reach me at qsl@n2rac.com or simply APRS message me at N2RAC-7.

A lot of the items here are still poorly documented if at all. Many also
rely on some weird or nuanced scripts or directory structures that I have
maintained on my own machine or server, so bear with me.
The non-indented comments are mine. The indented ones are by Alexandre.
A lot of this is trial-and-error for me, so again, please bear with me.
